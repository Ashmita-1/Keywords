*SOME TERMS*
1. CPU: Central Processing Unit. Its electronic circuitry executes instructions of a computer program, such as arithmetic, logic, controlling, and input/output (I/O) operations.
2. GPU: Graphic Proccessing Unit.  It is designed to accelerate computer graphics and image processing.
3. DPU: Data Processing Unit. It is a programmable computer processor used in place of traditional NICs to relieve the main CPU of complex networking responsibilities and other "infrastructural" duties that tightly integrates a general-purpose CPU with network interface hardware.
4. TPU: Tensor Processing Unit.  It is used to handle the computational demands of machine learning and accelerate AI calculations and algorithms
5. NICs: It is a hardware component, typically a circuit board or chip, which is installed on a computer so it can connect to a network.
