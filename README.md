1. Computation 2. Storage 3. Network
*SOME TERMS*
1. **CPU**: Central Processing Unit. Its electronic circuitry executes instructions of a computer program, such as arithmetic, logic, controlling, and input/output (I/O) operations.
   
2. **GPU**: Graphic Processing Unit.  It is designed to accelerate computer graphics and image processing.
   
3. **DPU**: Data Processing Unit. It is a programmable computer processor used in place of traditional NICs to relieve the main CPU of complex networking responsibilities and other "infrastructural" duties that tightly integrates a general-purpose CPU with network interface hardware.
   
4. **TPU**: Tensor Processing Unit.  It is used to handle the computational demands of machine learning and accelerate AI calculations and algorithms.
   
5. **NICs**: It is a hardware component, typically a circuit board or chip, which is installed on a computer so it can connect to a network.
    
6.  **ProxMox**: Proxmox Virtual Environment is a complete, open-source server management platform for enterprise virtualisation. It tightly integrates the KVM hypervisor and Linux Containers (LXC), software-defined storage and networking functionality, on a single platform.
    
7.  **KVM**: It is software which you can install in Linux machines to create virtual machines.
    
8.  **KVM Vs ProxMox**:  Proxmox is generally considered to be more user-friendly as compared to KVM.

9. **VMware**: became famous for its first type 2 hypervisor known as **GSX**. It virtualised the hardware for a video adapter, a network adapter, and hard disk adapters. The host provides pass-through drivers for guest USB, serial, and parallel devices. In this way, VMware virtual machines become highly portable between computers, because every host looks nearly identical to the guest.

10. **Kubernetes**:
